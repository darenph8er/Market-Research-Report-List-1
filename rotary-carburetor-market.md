<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Carburetor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float-Feed Carburetor</li><li>Diaphragm Carburetor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary carburetor market primarily features two types: float-feed carburetors and diaphragm carburetors. Float-feed carburetors utilize a float mechanism to maintain a consistent fuel level, ensuring optimal fuel-air mixture for combustion. They are commonly found in older internal combustion engines. In contrast, diaphragm carburetors use a diaphragm to regulate fuel flow, offering better sensitivity to changes in engine demand. This makes them ideal for applications requiring precise fuel management, such as in small engines and scooters.</p></p>
