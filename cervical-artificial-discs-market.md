<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cervical Artificial Discs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal</li><li>Biopolymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cervical artificial discs market comprises two primary types: metal and biopolymer. Metal artificial discs, typically made from titanium or cobalt chrome, offer durability and are designed to replicate natural disk function. They provide strong support and stability but may carry risks of wear over time. On the other hand, biopolymer discs, created from materials like polyethylene or elastomers, aim for improved biocompatibility and flexibility. They attempt to mimic natural cushioning and movement of the cervical spine more effectively.</p></p>
