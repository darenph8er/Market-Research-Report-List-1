<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EB Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive EB Resists</li><li>Negative EB Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electron beam (EB) resists are specialized materials used in lithography for microfabrication. The market is divided into positive and negative EB resists. Positive EB resists become soluble when exposed to electron beams, allowing desired patterns to be developed easily. In contrast, negative EB resists become insoluble upon exposure, creating a more robust pattern that remains after development. The demand for these resists varies based on application, with positive resists preferred for high-resolution features, while negative resists are favored for higher durability and stability.</p></p>
