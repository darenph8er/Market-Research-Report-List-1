<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerosol Therapy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs)</li><li>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerosol therapy equipment includes Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) and Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs). MDIs deliver precise doses of medication in aerosol form, using propellants for easy inhalation. They are user-friendly and widely used for conditions like asthma and COPD. DPIs, on the other hand, dispense medication in powder form and rely on the patient’s inhalation effort to activate the device. This offers a breath-actuated delivery method, often preferred due to their portability and lack of propellants. Both are critical in respiratory care.</p></p>
