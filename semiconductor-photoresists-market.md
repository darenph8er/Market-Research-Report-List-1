<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Photoresists</li><li>Positive Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semiconductor photoresists market is primarily divided into two types: negative and positive photoresists. Negative photoresists polymerize upon exposure to light, hardening the areas exposed and allowing the unexposed regions to be washed away. This technique is typically used for creating more intricate patterns. In contrast, positive photoresists become soluble in developers when exposed to light, leaving behind a patterned layer in the areas that were exposed. Both types are essential for precise microfabrication in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>
