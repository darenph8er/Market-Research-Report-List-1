<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Compressed Air Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive compressed air brake system market includes two main types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes use brake shoes that press against a rotating drum to create friction, slowing the vehicle. They are cost-effective and durable, commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor, offering better heat dissipation and stopping power, ideal for high-performance and modern vehicles. Both systems rely on compressed air for actuation, ensuring reliable braking in commercial and industrial applications.</p></p>
